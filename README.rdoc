= redmine_spent_time

This is a Redmine's plugin which allow users to add spent time entries for issues they have worked on. 
It gives users a comfortable form to do queries about their spent time on projects, along with a little form
to submit new entries. Of course also it's possible to delete entries and to modify existing ones.

From this functionality a user will be able to add time entries to assigned issues or to issues which he
has already spent some time but are not assigned to him.

== Installation

1. Go to your redmine root path/vendor/plugins.
2. At the command line type 'git clone https://github.com/eyp/redmine_spent_time.git'.
3. Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails).
4. Login and configure the plugin (Administration > Roles and permissions > Configure permissions for every role).
5. Click the _Spent time_ link in the top left menu.

== Permissions

There are some permissions which can be set up for every role.

* Time tracking -> _View spent time_: Activated by default, it allows the user to go to this plugin's main page.

== Usage

It's very easy to use, click the _Spent time_ link in the top left menu, from there you will be able to do queries and add entries.
