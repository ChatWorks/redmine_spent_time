<b>Tested on Redmine >= 2.3</b>

This is a {Redmine}[http://www.redmine.org]'s plugin which allow users to add spent time entries for issues they have worked on. 
It gives users a comfortable form to do queries about their spent time on projects, along with a little form
to submit new entries. Of course also it's possible to delete entries and to modify existing ones.

From this functionality a user will be able to add time entries to assigned issues or to issues which he
has already spent some time but are not assigned to him.

== Installation

1. Go to your redmine root path/plugins.
2. At the command line type <tt>git clone https://github.com/eyp/redmine_spent_time.git</tt>.
3. Install required gems (best_in_place is required) with bundler in redmine directory: <tt>cd .. && bundle install</tt>
4. Restart your Redmine web servers (e.g. mongrel, thin, mod_rails).
5. Login and configure the plugin (see Permissions section.)
6. Click the 'Spent time' link in the top left menu.

== Permissions

There are some permissions which can be set up for every role from the Administration -> Roles and permissions.

* Time tracking -> 'View spent time': Activated by default, it allows the user to go to this plugin's main page.
* Project -> 'View others spent time': Deactivated by default, it allows the user to view the time spent of other members of the projects his is member of.
* Project -> 'View every project spent time': Deactivated by default, it allows to view the spent time of everyone.

== Usage

It's very easy to use, click the 'Spent time' link in the top left menu, from there you will be able to do queries and add entries.
